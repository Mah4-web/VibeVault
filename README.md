# 🎨 VibeVault – Where Aesthetics Live

## 🖼️ Accessible & Responsive Image Gallery

VibeVault is a React-based image gallery that fetches images and illustrations from the Unsplash API. The app is fully keyboard-accessible, responsive across devices, and includes smooth animations, modal navigation, and alt-text for screen readers. Built with Vite, Tailwind CSS, and modern React practices.

---

## 🚀 Features

- 🔍 Searchable gallery using Unsplash API
- 🖼️ Thumbnail grid with hover animations
- 📷 Modal popup with full-size image and navigation
- ♿ Keyboard accessible (Enter/Space)
- ✅ Lighthouse & Safari accessibility audits: **100%**
- 💅 Responsive design using Tailwind & custom CSS
- 🔐 Environment variable setup for secure API key

---

## 🧠 What I Learned

This project helped me strengthen and apply the following concepts and tools:

### ⚛️ React (with Vite)
- Components 
- Props and event handling
- State management using `useState`
- Side effects using `useEffect`
- Conditional rendering
- Lists and keys
- Debugging with React Dev Tools
- Environment variables with Vite

### 🎨 Styling & UI
- Responsive design with Tailwind CSS
- UI styling approach
- Animated text and transitions

### 🚀 Deployment & Workflow
- Project setup with Vite
- Version control with Git & GitHub
- Deployment using Render

## 🎯 Requirements

🎯 Implement the useState hook to manage gallery state (e.g. selected image).
🎯 Use useEffect for initial fetching of images from an external API.
🎯 Return JSX from multiple components (e.g., an ImageItem component for each image and a Gallery component to display them).
🎯 Use the .map() function to render an array of images dynamically
🎯 Implement functionality to display a larger version of an image when its thumbnail is clicked.
🎯 Ensure all images have meaningful alt text.
🎯 Ensure basic keyboard navigation for image selection (e.g., thumbnails should be focusable and activatable with Enter/Space).

## 🎯 Stretch Requirements

🏹 Use useEffect and the dependancy array to update the images when the user types in an input field.
🏹 Set up an Unsplash application that you can fetch from your React app.
🏹 Use .env to hide your API keys and tokens from the code.
🏹 Style the application excellently, using grid or flex and positioning.

## 🧗 Challenges 

This project was more than just building a React app — it was a full learning journey that pushed me to think like a developer, solve real-world problems, and build something I'm truly proud of.

### 🔄 From Simplicity to Complexity

I began with a simple idea: an image gallery using the Unsplash API. I had worked with modals and event handling in earlier workshops (like the "basket of fruits" example), so I thought this would be straightforward. But things quickly became more complex once I introduced **keyboard accessibility**, **modal navigation**, and responsive design.

---

### 🧠 Learning React the Real Way

I had to read through **React documentation**, **follow tutorials**, and **experiment repeatedly** to understand how to manage selected images, navigate forward/backward, and ensure that the modal reflects the correct image.

---

### 🎨 Styling, Tailwind & Animation

I used **Tailwind CSS** to build a responsive, clean UI, and even implemented **animated alt descriptions** using custom keyframes. At one point, I had to fight with `z-index` to make the modal appear correctly without breaking the layout — I literally started with `z-500` and debugged layer by layer.

---

### 🧩 The Hardest Part: Modal Navigation

Adding previous/next buttons seemed easy — but getting them to actually work was tough. I:
- Followed class notes to structure the buttons
- Wrote the navigation logic using `useState` and `useEffect`
- Struggled to make it functional until I found a helpful YouTube video and adapted the approach
- Faced syntax errors, logic bugs, and moments where “nothing worked” — but I kept debugging

---

### 🐛 Real Errors, Real Debugging

Some real-world problems I solved:
- I used the wrong folder in my **Render deployment** (`npm run build` pointed to the wrong place), then fixed it by going back to notes
- Imported unused CSS files which caused errors — so I commented them out
- Modal wasn’t covering the screen — fixed it by adding a **default image** and adjusting `z-index`
- Sometimes forgot a `)` or `}` — simple bugs that cost a lot of time, but taught me to slow down and double-check. 

---

### 🔐 API & Environment Variables

Getting the Unsplash API working taught me how to:
- Read and understand API documentation
- Secure keys using `.env` and **Vite environment variables**
- Use `fetch` inside `useEffect` and wrangle API data properly

---

## 🧘 Lessons Learned

> _"Starting simple helped me focus, but as the complexity grew, I had to dig into docs, revisit notes, test repeatedly, and learn by doing. I’m proud that I built something fully functional, accessible, and good-looking from scratch."_ 💪

### 🧠 Final Takeaway

What started as a small assignment became a full app — with accessibility, responsive UI, animations, keyboard controls, and custom API integration. I learned how to:
- Solve problems without panicking (It doesn't mean I didn't panick 😉)
- Debug complex behavior
- Use documentation, community forums, and videos as real tools
- Build something meaningful from scratch

I'm proud of how much I’ve grown, and even more excited about what comes next. 💪🚀
