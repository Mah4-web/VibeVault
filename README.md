# üé® VibeVault ‚Äì Where Aesthetics Live

## üñºÔ∏è Accessible & Responsive Image Gallery

VibeVault is a React-based image gallery that fetches images and illustrations from the Unsplash API. The app is fully keyboard-accessible, responsive across devices, and includes smooth animations, modal navigation, and alt-text for screen readers. Built with Vite, Tailwind CSS, and modern React practices.

## üß† What I Learned

This project helped me strengthen and apply the following concepts and tools:

### ‚öõÔ∏è React (with Vite)
- Components 
- Props and event handling
- State management using `useState`
- Side effects using `useEffect`
- Conditional rendering
- Lists and keys
- Debugging with React Dev Tools
- Environment variables with Vite

### üé® Styling & UI
- Responsive design with Tailwind CSS
- UI styling approach
- Animated text and transitions

### üöÄ Deployment & Workflow
- Project setup with Vite
- Version control with Git & GitHub
- Deployment using Render

---

## üéØ Requirements

üéØ Implement the useState hook to manage gallery state (e.g. selected image).
üéØ Use useEffect for initial fetching of images from an external API.
üéØ Return JSX from multiple components (e.g., an ImageItem component for each image and a Gallery component to display them).
üéØ Use the .map() function to render an array of images dynamically
üéØ Implement functionality to display a larger version of an image when its thumbnail is clicked.
üéØ Ensure all images have meaningful alt text.
üéØ Ensure basic keyboard navigation for image selection (e.g., thumbnails should be focusable and activatable with Enter/Space).

## üéØ Stretch Requirements

üèπ Use useEffect and the dependancy array to update the images when the user types in an input field.
üèπ Set up an Unsplash application that you can fetch from your React app.
üèπ Use .env to hide your API keys and tokens from the code.
üèπ Style the application excellently, using grid or flex and positioning.

## üßó Challenges 

This project was more than just building a React app ‚Äî it was a full learning journey that pushed me to think like a developer, solve real-world problems, and build something I'm truly proud of.

### üîÑ From Simplicity to Complexity

I began with a simple idea: an image gallery using the Unsplash API. I had worked with modals and event handling in earlier workshops (like the "basket of fruits" example), so I thought this would be straightforward. But things quickly became more complex once I introduced **keyboard accessibility**, **modal navigation**, and responsive design.

---

### üß† Learning React the Real Way

I had to read through **React documentation**, **follow tutorials**, and **experiment repeatedly** to understand how to manage selected images, navigate forward/backward, and ensure that the modal reflects the correct image.

---

### üé® Styling, Tailwind & Animation

I used **Tailwind CSS** to build a responsive, clean UI, and even implemented **animated alt descriptions** using custom keyframes. At one point, I had to fight with `z-index` to make the modal appear correctly without breaking the layout ‚Äî I literally started with `z-500` and debugged layer by layer.

---

### üß© The Hardest Part: Modal Navigation

Adding previous/next buttons seemed easy ‚Äî but getting them to actually work was tough. I:
- Followed class notes to structure the buttons
- Wrote the navigation logic using `useState` and `useEffect`
- Struggled to make it functional until I found a helpful YouTube video and adapted the approach
- Faced syntax errors, logic bugs, and moments where ‚Äúnothing worked‚Äù ‚Äî but I kept debugging

---

### üêõ Real Errors, Real Debugging

Some real-world problems I solved:
- I used the wrong folder in my **Render deployment** (`npm run build` pointed to the wrong place), then fixed it by going back to notes
- Imported unused CSS files which caused errors ‚Äî so I commented them out
- Modal wasn‚Äôt covering the screen ‚Äî fixed it by adding a **default image** and adjusting `z-index`
- Sometimes forgot a `)` or `}` ‚Äî simple bugs that cost a lot of time, but taught me to slow down and double-check. 

---

### üîê API & Environment Variables

Getting the Unsplash API working taught me how to:
- Read and understand API documentation
- Secure keys using `.env` and **Vite environment variables**
- Use `fetch` inside `useEffect` and wrangle API data properly

---

## üßò Lessons Learned

> _"Starting simple helped me focus, but as the complexity grew, I had to dig into docs, revisit notes, test repeatedly, and learn by doing. I‚Äôm proud that I built something fully functional, accessible, and good-looking from scratch."_ üí™

## üì∏ Credits

- Images: Unsplash

- Inspiration: Week 2 and 6 React workshops + Accessibility labs

- My Mentor: Manuel Gonzalez

### üß† Final Takeaway

What started as a small assignment became a full app ‚Äî with accessibility, responsive UI, animations, keyboard controls, and custom API integration. I learned how to:
- Solve problems without panicking (It doesn't mean I didn't panick üòâ)
- Debug complex behavior
- Use documentation, community forums, and videos as real tools
- Build something meaningful from scratch

I'm proud of how much I‚Äôve grown, and even more excited about what comes next. üí™üöÄ
